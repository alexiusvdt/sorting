## Sorting Algorithms
This project aims to show knowledge of interfaces and sorting algorithms

# Goals
  * users can view various sorting algorithms at work
  * users can sort ascending or descending

# Technology
* Flask API (not yet implemented)
* PyGame

# Installation
* clone this repository
* navigate to the top level directory in a command line interface
* run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages
* run the main.py file to access the sorting display

# Thanks
* Tech with Tim (youtube) for base functionality
* Mike C for the guidance and experience

# Bugs / issues
* graphs sometimes generate bars from top to bottom like the yaxis is inverted...maybe have to floor() it or somehow prevent negatives?
* venv activation restricted on windows for some reason. setting user policies not working, will implement later
