## Sorting Algorithms
This project is a **work in progress** so pardon the dust.

Sorting algorithms are used to put elements of a list into an order, either numeric or lexicographical. In this application, I hope to show various sorting algorithms and their strengths or weaknesses. 

While perhaps not the most straightforward implementation for this project, I wanted to demonstrate knowledge of distributed systems, sorting algorithms, API usage, and interfaces/abstract Classes.

Ratings are just my opinion on each algorithms' speed and efficiency. Struckthrough items not yet implemented.

| Algorithm       | Complexity     | Rating      |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Selection sort  | O(n^2)        | 2/5          |
| Bubble sort     | O(n^2)        | 2/5          |
| Insertion sort  | O(n^2)        | 3/5          |
| Bogo sort       | O((n+1)!)     | 0/5          |
| Not yet implemented| --- | --- |
| Merge sort      | O(n log n)    | 5/5          |
| Quick sort      | O(n log n)    | 5/5          |
| Heap sort       | O(n log n)    | 4/5          |
| Counting sort   | O(n + k)      | 4/5          |
| Radix sort      | O(n * k)      | 4/5          |
| Bucket sort     | O(n + k)      | 4/5          |
| Miracle sort    | O(‚àû)          | 0/5          |


# Flow
  * an API request is sent to the `sort` endpoint
  * the backend instantiates a TypeSort class and performs the work
  * the backend returns iterative steps to the react application for presentation
  * users can play the algorithm sorting steps
  
# Technologies / Frameworks Used
* flask 
* axios
* react-icons
* jsdoc
* pipreqs

# Installation
* clone this repository to your workspace
* navigate to the `flask` directory in a command line interface
* create the virtual environment(venv) by entering `python -m venv .venv`. 
  * Note: `.venv` is the name for the resulting environment. You may name this however you wish, just replace `.venv` with your desired name in these commands.
* activate the virtual environment:
  * if on Windows:
    * `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
  * if Mac/Linux (bash shell):
    * `source .venv/bin/activate`
* install necessary packages to the venv: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* run flask with `flask run` to start in dev mode
* in a second terminal window, navigate to `frontend` directory
* run the react frontend with `npm run start`

# Thanks
* Tech with Tim (youtube) for a jumping-off point and helpful pygame tutorial
* Mike C & Billy F for the guidance and experience
* Susuwatari for her endless rubber duck debugging help üê±

# Bugs / Issues
* It's not finished yet!

# ToDo / Improvements
* Improve playback controls
* Increase visual clarity of swaps/passes made
* add a warning/confirmation before submitting bogo request (long response times)
* add descending sort options
